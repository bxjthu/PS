##A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding

.smaller[By Jonathan Swift; Presented by Chen Zhangwei]

Good manners are the art of making those people easy with whom we converse.

So that the difference between good breeding and good manners lies in this, that the former cannot be attained to by the best understandings, without study and labour; whereas a tolerable degree of reason will instruct us in every part of good manners, without other assistance.

I insist that good sense is the principal foundation of good manners.

Ignorance of forms cannot properly be styled ill manners; because forms are subject to frequent changes.

Jonathan Swift, who in Gulliver's Travels
Big-Endian and Little-Endian
This passage is a satire on the conflict between the Roman Catholic church and the Church of England and the associated conflict between France and England.

##A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding

.smaller[By Jonathan Swift; Presented by Yuan Jiangyue]

Therefore I insist that good sense is the principal foundation of good manners; but because the former is a gift which very few among mankind are possessed of, therefore all the civilized nations of the world have agreed upon fixing some rules for common be­haviour, best suited to their general customs, or fancies, as a kind of artificial good sense, to supply the defects of reason.

##A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding

.smaller[By Jonathan Swift; Presented by Yuan Jiangyue]

As the common forms of good manners were intended for regu­lating the conduct of those who have weak understandings; so they have been corrupted by the persons for whose use they were contrived. For these people have fallen into a needless and endless way of multiplying ceremonies, which have been extremely trouble­ some to those who practice them, and insupportable to everybody else: insomuch that wise men are often more uneasy at the over civility of these refiners, than they could possibly be in the conversations of peasants or mechanics.

So that the difference between good breed­ing and good manners lies in this, that the former cannot be attained to by the best understandings, without study and labour; whereas a tolerable degree of reason will instruct us in every part of good man­ners, without other assistance.

##A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding

.smaller[By Jonathan Swift; Presented by Qian Yijun]

Good manners is the art of making those people easy with whom we converse. Whoever makes the fewest persons uneasy is the best bred in the company. As the best law is founded upon reason, so are the best manners. And as some lawyers have introduced unreasonable things into common law, so likewise many teachers have introduced absurd things into common good manners.

Therefore I insist that good sense is the principal foundation of good manners; but because the former is a gift which very few among mankind are possessed of, therefore all the civilized nations of the world have agreed upon fixing some rules for common behaviour, best suited to their general customs, o-r fancies, as a kind of artificial good sense, to supply the defects of reason.

##A Treatise on Good Manners and Good Breeding

.smaller[By Jonathan Swift; Presented by Qian Yijun]

There is a pedantry in manners, as in all arts and sciences; and sometimes in trades. Pedantry is properly the overrating any kind of knowledge we pretend to. And if that kind of knowledge be a trifle in itself, the pedantry is the greater.

Whence I have long concluded, that good manners are not a plant of the court growth: for if they were, those people who have understandings directly of a level for such acquirement, and who have served such long apprenticeships to nothing else, would certainly have picked them up.

So that the difference between good breeding and good manners lies in this, that the former cannot be attained to by the best understandings, without study and labour; whereas a tolerable degree of reason will instruct us in every part of good manners, without other assistance.

##The Education of Women

.smaller[By Daniel Defoe; Presented by Song Haoxin]

[They] should be taught all sorts of breeding suitable both to their genius and quality. And in particular, Music and Dancing; which it would be cruelty to bar the sex of, because they are their darlings. But besides this, they should be taught languages, as particularly French and Italian: and I would venture the injury of giving a woman more tongues than one.

She is all softness and sweetness, peace, love, wit, and delight. She is every way suitable to the sublimest wish, and the man that has such a one to his portion, has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful.

##The Education of Women

.smaller[By Daniel Defoe; Presented by Song Haoxin]<br><br>

.smaller[
If her temper be good, want of education makes her soft and easy.<br>

Her wit, for want of teaching, makes her impertinent and talkative.<br>

Her knowledge, for want of judgement and experience, makes her fanciful and whimsical.<br>

If her temper be bad, want of breeding makes her worse; and she grows haughty, insolent, and loud.<br>

If she be passionate, want of manners makes her a termagant and a scold, which is much at one with Lunatic.<br>

If she be proud, want of discretion (which still is breeding) makes her conceited, fantastic, and ridiculous.<br>

And from these she degenerates to be turbulent, clamorous, noisy, nasty, the devil!...

## The Education of Women
.smaller[By Daniel Defoe; Presented by Yun Qianyu]

Women also have the ability to be well-educated if given the access to education

Women have their special temperaments, such as accuracy in senses, and sensibility by born

Everyone has the right to be educated and become a complete, sensible person. The nature or temperaments by born isn’t so important.

## The Education of The Human Race

.smaller[By Gotthold Ephraim Lessing; Presented by Fu Hongyuan]

That which Education is to the Individual, Revelation is to the Race.

Education is Revelation coming to the Individual Man; and Revelation is Education which has come, and is yet coming, to the Human Race.

Education has its goal, in the Race, no less than in the Individual.

## The Education of The Human Race

.smaller[By Gotthold Ephraim Lessing; Presented by Fu Hongyuan]

The flattering prospects which are open to the people, the Honor and Well-being which are painted to him, what are they more than the means of educating him to become a man, who, when these prospects of Honor and Well-being have vanished, shall be able to do his Duty?

The enthusiast often casts true glances into the future, but for this future he can not wait.

And what if it were as good as proved that the vast flow wheel which brings mankind nearer to this perfection is only put in motion by smaller, swifter wheels, each of which contributes its own individual unit thereto?

##Some Thoughts on Education

.smaller[By John Locke; Presented by Wang Anlan]

How necessary health is to our business and happiness; and how requisite a strong constitution, able to endure hardships and fatigue, is to one that will make any figure in the world, is too ob­vious to need any proof.

And the great principle and foundation of all virtue and worth is placed in this: that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, tho' the appetite lean the other way.

If you would have him stand in awe of you, imprint it in his infancy; and as he approaches more to a man, admit him nearer to your familiarity; so shall you have him your obedient subject (as is fit) whilst he is a child, and your affec­tionate friend when he is a man.

A sound mind in a sound soul.

A man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way.

The instructor should remember that his business is not so much to teach the child all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself.

## The Idea of a University

.smaller[By John Henry Newman; Presented by Bian Ge]

Accordingly, in its simple and rudimental form, it is a school of knowledge of every kind, consisting of teachers and learners from every quarter. Many things are requisite to complete and satisfy the idea embodied in this description; but such as this a University seems to be in its essence, a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of personal intercourse, through a wide extent of country.

We must come to the teachers of wisdom to learn wisdom, we must repair to the fountain, and drink there.

## The Idea of a University

.smaller[By John Henry Newman; Presented by Bian Ge]

In every great country, the metropolis itself becomes a sort of necessary University, whether we will or no. ...The newspapers, magazines, reviews, journals and periodicals of all kinds, the publishing trade, the libraries, museums, and academies there found, the learned and scientific societies, necessarily invest it with the functions of a University; and that atmosphere of intellect, which in former age hung over Oxford or Bologna or Salamanca, has, with the change of times, moved away to the centre of civil government.

## The Idea of a University

.smaller[By John Henry Newman; Presented by Bian Ge]

A University is a place of concourse, whither students come from every quarter for every kind of knowledge. You cannot have the best of every kind everywhere; you must go to some great city or emporium for it.

It is a place which wins the admiration of the young by its celebrity, kindles the affections of the middle-aged by its beauty, and rivets the fidelity of the old by its associations.

No awful arch, no window of many-coloured lights marks the seats of learning there or elsewhere; philosophy lives out of doors. No close atmosphere oppresses the brain or inflames the eyelid; no long session stiffens the limbs. Epicurus is reclining in his garden; Zeno looks like a divinity in his porch; the restless Aristotle, on the other side of the city, as if in antagonism to Plato, is walking his pupils off their legs in his Lyceum by the Ilyssus.

##The Idea of University

.smaller[By John Henry Newman; Presented by Xiao Ziyi]

Hence it is that the Sciences, into which our knowledge may be said to be cast, have multiplied bearings one on another, and an internal sympathy, and admit, or rather demand, comparison and adjustment. They complete, correct, balance each other. This consideration, if well-founded, must be taken into account, not only as regards the attainment of truth, which is their common end, but as regards the influence which they exercise upon those whose education consists in the study of them.

##The Idea of University

.smaller[By John Henry Newman; Presented by Xiao Ziyi]

I have said already, that to give undue prominence to one is to be unjust to another; to neglect or supersede these is to divert those from their proper object. It is to unsettle the boundary lines between science and science, to disturb their action, to destroy the harmony which binds them together. Such a proceeding will have a corresponding effect when introduced into a place of education. There is no science but tells a different tale, when viewed as a portion of a whole, from what it is likely to suggest when taken by itself, without the safeguard, as I may call it, of others.

##Inaugural Address at Edinburgh

.smaller[By Thomas Carlyle; Presented by Li Xingze]

You are ever to bear in mind that there lies behind that the acquisition of what may be called wisdom---namely, sound appreciation and the just decision as to all the objects that come around you, and the habit of behaving with justice, candour, clear insight, and loyal adherence to fact. Great is wisdom; infinite is the value of wisdom. It cannot be exaggerated; it is the highest achievement of man: “Blessed is he that get the understanding.”

People have become doubtful whether colleges are now the real source of wisdom; whether they are anything more, anything much more, than a cultivating of man in the specific arts.

##Inaugural Address at Edinburgh

.smaller[By Thomas Carlyle; Presented by Li Xingze]

All that sad stuff being the too well-known product of our method of vocal education, the teacher merely operates on the tongue of the pupil, and teaches him to wag it in a particular way. In effect, it is an education not vocal at all, but mute except where speaking was strictly needful.

There is a time to speak, and a time to be silent. Silence withal is the eternal duty of a man.

You may feel often as if the whole world were obstructing you, setting itself against you; but you will find that to mean only, that the world is travelling in a different way from you, and rushing on in its own path, heedlessly treads on you.

##Of Studies

.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Qiu Jiaxing]

Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.

Nay, there is no stond or impediment in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies; like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises.

##Of Studies

.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Qiu Jiaxing]

So if a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he must begin again. If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let him study the Schoolmen; for they are cymini sectores [splitters of hairs]. If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study the lawyers' cases. So every defect of the mind may have a special receipt.

## Of Studies
.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Li Jiongzhou]

STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of business.

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.

## Of Studies
.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Li Jiongzhou]

Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit: and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not.

_Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend._

##Of Nature in Man

Nature is often hidden; sometimes overcome; seldom extinguished. Force makes nature more violent in the return; doctrine and discourse make nature less importuned; but custom only does alter and subdue nature.

##Of Custom and Education

.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Du Lite]

Many examples may be put of the force of custom, both upon the mind and the body. Therefore, since the custom is the principal magistrate of man's life. Let man by all means endeavor to obtain good customs. Certainly custom is most perfect when it beginneth in young years: this we call education; which is, in effect, but an early custom.

##Of Custom and Education

.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Du Lite]

But if the force of custom simple and seperate be great, the force of custom copulate and cojoined and collegiate is far greater. For there example teacheth, company comforteth, emulation quickeneth, glory raiseth: so as in such places the force of custom is in his exalation (at his height).

##Of Travel
.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Chuantian Zhizi]

TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience.

When a traveller returneth home, let him not leave the countries where he hath travelled altogether behind him; but maintain a correspondence by letters with those of his acquaintance which are of most worth... let it appear that he doth not change his country manners for those of foreign parts; but only prick in some flowers of that he hath learned abroad into the customs of his own country.

TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience.

He that travelleth into a country before he hath some entrance into the language, goeth to school, and not to travel. That young men travel under some tutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so that he be such a one that hath the language, and hath been in the country before; whereby he may be able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen in the country where they go; what acquaintances they are to seek; what exercises or discipline the place yieldeth.

##Of Travel
.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Yang Zonghao]

Let him carry with him also some card or book describing the country where he travelleth; which will be a good key to his inquiry. Let him keep also a diary. Let him not stay long in one city or town; ...

As for the acquaintance which is to be sought in travel; that which is most of all profitable is acquaintance with the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors: for so in travelling in one country he shall suck the experience of many.

##Of Parents and Children
.smaller[By Francis Bacon; Presented by Wu Jingwen]

The joys of parents are secret; and so are their griefs and fears. They cannot utter the one; nor they will not utter the other. Children sweeten labors; but they make misfortunes more bitter. They increase the cares of life; but they mitigate the remembrance of death.

Let parents choose betimes the vocations and courses they mean their children should take; for then they are most flexible; and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children, as thinking they will take best to that which they have most mind to.

Men have a foolish manner (both parents and schoolmasters and servants) in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers during childhood, which many times sorteth to discord when they are men, and disturbeth families. The Italians make little differ­ence between children and nephews or near kinsfolks;

... till poverty or youthful years call them importunately their several ways, and hasten them with the sway of friends either to an ambitious and mercenary, or ignorantly zealous divinity;...

... while their young and pliant affections are led through all the moral works of Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Plutarch, Laertius and those Locrian remnants; but still to be reduced in their nightward studies wherewith they close the day's work, under the determinate sentence of David or Solomon, or the evanges and apostolic scriptures.

Education is the advancement of life.

All books are divisible into two classes, the books of the hour, and the books of all time.

If you will not rise to us, we cannot stoop to you. The living lord may assume courtesy, the living philosopher explain his thought to you with considerate pain; but here we neither feign nor interpret; you must rise to the level of our thoughts if you would be gladdened by them, and share our feelings, if you would recognize our presence.
