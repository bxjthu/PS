**Emojis are being more and more frequently used in our electronic messages. It is said that the new** 

**front-facing camera of iPhone X will let owners bring emojis to life. Just by looking at the screen, users** 

**can see a live image of themselves as a talking panda, chicken, or even poop emoji. How do you view **

**this trend and the new feature of iPhone X?**

**From the stories of ancient Greece to science fiction movies, immortality has long been something that **

**humans have talked about. We’re often told that the secret to a longer life is down to eating a healthy **

**diet and taking regular exercise. More recently, scientists say the answer could lie in the naked mole**

**rat. How do you view the determined efforts of humans to delay their aging process?**

**A recent study, called Media Insight Project, discovered something interesting. The project, funded by **

**the American Press Institute and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found **

**that people’s trust in a piece of content on Facebook was stronger if they trusted the person who shared **

**it, regardless of which organization published it. How do you view this finding?**

**“The written word endures, the spoken word disappears; and that is why writing is closer to the truth **

**than speaking.” Neil Postman says so in his Amusing Ourselves to Death. Do you agree with him on this**

**point?**

**Self-employment, contract or freelance work, temporary jobs – just about anything that isn’t full-time – **

**can be described as a gig. The rise of the gig economy came along with the evolution of on-demand or **

**“as-needed” hiring. Digital ordering, stock management, sales and expenses programs have made large **

**teams of full-time staff a thing of the past, with some companies taking on temporary workers as and **

**when they need them. As a university student, how do you view this trend and how would you react to **

**it?**

**It used to be a matter of fact when Peter Pan – a character from James Matthew Barrie’s 1911 book – **

**said: “All children, except one, grow up.” But this “fact” doesn’t seem to apply to today’s world **

**anymore. According to the NPD Group, a US market research company, sales of toys to adults in the UK **

**increased by more than 20 percent in 2016, three times the pace of the children’s toy market itself. **

**These toys ranged from puzzles and Lego building sets to vehicle models and action figures. How do you **

**view this new “fact”?**

**The chief executive of London’s Saatchi Gallery, Nigel Hurst, told The Guardian: “The selfie generation **

**is becoming the self-expression generation as each of us seeks to explore and share our inner creativity **

**through the one artistic tool to which we all have access – the smartphone.” Do you think of the **

**Internet as a gallery and of the selfie generation as artists?**

**Harvard professor Eric Mazur encourages students to bring their laptops and mobile phones into **

**exams. With these devices, students can “look up whatever they want, whenever they want” and be **

**tested on their creative and analytical skills, rather than the ability to remember information, he said **

**during the Times Higher Education World Academic Summit in September this year. Do you agree with **

**him on this point?**

**Whatever critics say, it isn’t unusual to see people lining up for tickets for those blockbuster sequels: **

**the Fast and the Furious, Transformers, Spiderman, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. etc. Why is that? **

**Besides the obvious – people continue to enjoy them – what is the appeal of going to see a film that in **

**many respects will be very similar to one people saw two years before?**
