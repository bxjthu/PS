## The Soul

Shape without form, shade without colour,<br>
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
T. S. Eliot

### Topic:

The roles of university education

+ Creator and repositories of knowledge

+ Larger educational roles
  + to turn 18- and 19-year-old freshmen into 21- and 22-year-old adults
  + to help them grow up, to learn who they are, to search for a larger purpose for their lives, to leave college as better human beings

So totally has the goal of scholarly excellence overshadowed universities' educational role that they have forgotten that
the two need not be in conflict.

+ Excellence without a soul
  + Excellent students/universities/education/teachers/campuses
  + Excellent with a soul

Questions: Do you think your are an excellent student with or without a soul? What is the soul?

+ FUNG YU-LAN: A Short History of Chinese Philosophy  
  The purpose of the study of philosophy is to enable a man, as a man, to be a man, not some particular kind of man.

+ Henry David Thoreau: Walden
  In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line.<br>

+ Bertrand Russell: The Value of Philosophy
  HAVING now come to the end of our brief and very incomplete review of the problems of philosophy, it will be well to consider, in conclusion, what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.

  This view of philosophy appears to result, partly from a wrong conception of the ends of life, partly from a wrong conception of the kind of goods which philosophy strives to achieve. Physical science, through the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who are wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to be recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the student, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. Thus utility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only indirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it. It is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of philosophy must be primarily sought.

  But further, if we are not to fail in our endeavour to determine the value of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices of what are wrongly called 'practical' men. The 'practical' man, as this word is often used, is one who recognizes only material needs, who realizes that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the necessity of providing food for the mind. If all men were well off, if poverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point, there would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society; and even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as important as the goods of the body. It is exclusively among the goods of the mind that the value of philosophy is to be found; and only those who are not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of philosophy is not a waste of time.

+ Michael S. Roth: Beyond Critical Thinking
  The skill at unmasking error, or simple intellectual one-upmanship, is not completely without value, but we should be wary of creating a class of self-satisfied debunkers or, to use a currently fashionable word on campuses, people who like to "trouble" ideas. In overdeveloping the capacity to show how texts, institutions, or people fail to accomplish what they set out to do, we may be depriving students of the capacity to learn as much as possible from what they study. In a humanities culture in which being smart often means being a critical unmasker, our students may become too good at showing how things don't make sense. That very skill may diminish their capacity to find or create meaning and direction in the books they read and the world in which they live. Once outside the university, our students continue to score points by displaying the critical prowess for which they were rewarded in school. They wind up contributing to a cultural climate that has little tolerance for finding or making meaning, whose intellectuals and cultural commentators delight in being able to show that somebody else is not to be believed.

+ T. S. Eliot: Tradition and the Individual Talent
  No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not one-sided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new. Whoever has approved this idea of order, of the form of European, of English literature, will not find it preposterous that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past. And the poet who is aware of this will be aware of great difficulties and responsibilities.

+ Walt Whitman: O Me! O Life!
  O Me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring;	<br>
  Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish;	 <br>
  Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?) <br>
  Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d;	 <br>
  Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me; <br>
  Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined;	 <br>
  The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?	 <br>
  Answer.<br>
  That you are here—that life exists, and identity;	 <br>
  That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.
