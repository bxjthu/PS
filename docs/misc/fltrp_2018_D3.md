## The Soul

Shape without form, shade without colour,<br>
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
T. S. Eliot

### Topic:

The roles of university education

+ Creator and repositories of knowledge

+ Larger educational roles
  + to turn 18- and 19-year-old freshmen into 21- and 22-year-old adults
  + to help them grow up, to learn who they are, to search for a larger purpose for their lives, to leave college as better human beings

So totally has the goal of scholarly excellence overshadowed universities' educational role that they have forgotten that
the two need not be in conflict.

+ Excellence without a soul
  + Excellent students/universities/education/teachers/campuses
  + Excellent with a soul

Questions: Do you think your are an excellent student with or without a soul? What is the soul?

### Random notes:

The purpose of the study of philosophy is to enable a man, as a man, to be a man, not some particular kind of man.

The skill at unmasking error, or simple intellectual one-upmanship, is not completely without value, but we should be wary of creating a class of self-satisfied debunkers or, to use a currently fashionable word on campuses, people who like to "trouble" ideas. In overdeveloping the capacity to show how texts, institutions, or people fail to accomplish what they set out to do, we may be depriving students of the capacity to learn as much as possible from what they study. In a humanities culture in which being smart often means being a critical unmasker, our students may become too good at showing how things don't make sense. That very skill may diminish their capacity to find or create meaning and direction in the books they read and the world in which they live. Once outside the university, our students continue to score points by displaying the critical prowess for which they were rewarded in school. They wind up contributing to a cultural climate that has little tolerance for finding or making meaning, whose intellectuals and cultural commentators delight in being able to show that somebody else is not to be believed.

In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line.<br>
Henry David Thoreau: Walden


No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not one-sided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new. Whoever has approved this idea of order, of the form of European, of English literature, will not find it preposterous that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past. And the poet who is aware of this will be aware of great difficulties and responsibilities.<br>
