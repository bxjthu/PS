### Day 1 (Dec. 4)

+ 已备演讲及问答
  + 昨天练习时，已备的精神头还没上来，今晚争取找到感觉。
  + 关于已备的几类问题，理清自己的观点，准备相应的论据。
    + How did you turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones or what do you plan to do? (昨天用的是一个过去的例子，再试着想想和当前学习生活相关的例子。)
    + How are your “stones” different from those of your father? How are your “stones” similar to those of your father?
    + How would you decide if a stumbling block will turn into a stepping stone? If there are many stumbling blocks in front of you, how would you decide which one to turn first?
    + How do you perceive the new world that you have to face and the new world China has to face?

+ 专题整理（理清自己现阶段的主要观点，总结自己现有的迷惑；可结合已备演讲的内容）
  + 国家发展类（How do you perceive the new world that you have to face and the new world China has to face?）
  + 教育类 (What is the purpose of education in general? What is the purpose of college education in particular?)
  + 家庭类 (What are the roles of a family in one's life? How do you perceive the relationship among family members?)
