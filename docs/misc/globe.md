## GLobal Perspective

+ Each age writes its own history. Not because the earlier history is wrong, but because each age faces new problems, asks new questions, and seeks new answers. This precept is self-evident today when the tempo of change is increasing exponentially.

+ As human beings on the planet, we have been exploring Mother Earth, viewing and reviewing it for thousands of years, and then in 1972 the very first picture was taken from a spacecraft presenting us with a global view and we were able to see "the whole thing".
  + The Blue Marble is an image of the Earth made on December 7, 1972, by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft at a distance of about 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) from the surface. It is one of the most reproduced images in human history.

+ Leften Stavrianos (1964: 617): "What does this new [global] perspective mean...? It means the perspective of an observer perched on the moon rather than ensconced in London or Paris or Washington."

+ Globalization in the Hellenistic Age (336– 31 B.C.E): “… it brought the East and West together, breaking the separate molds that had been formed through history. People for the first time thought of the entire civilized world as a unit. At the first time the Greeks and Macedonians went to the East as conquerors and rulers and imposed a pattern of Hellenization. But in the process they themselves were changed, so that the resulting Hellenistic civilization was a blend rather than a transplantation.”
